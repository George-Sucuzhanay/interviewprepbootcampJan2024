Two Pointers Problems (set of algorithms):
    - sliding window
    - fast/slow pointer

always have a left and right pointer indicies (not c++ pointers)

while l < r:

will halt when l and r meet at the same index



while r < n:   (sliding window) where n is the input size
similar to for r in range(n):

[ _    _     _   _    _     _     _ ]
l1 .....
dynamic size
move r until some condition is invalid
then we move l until condition is valid again

static sized windows
sliding window of size 2 means the length btw my left and right poitner is always 2
