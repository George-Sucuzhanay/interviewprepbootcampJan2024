Trie:
k-ary tree used for storing prefixes

Binary Tree (2-ary) is a type of k-ary tree
where every node has at most 2 children

K-ary:
every node has at most k-children

trie store string words

               O
    a          b            c

l     p        a   e        a

l     e        d            t

all nodes in a hold words that start with a 
same with all the other nodes

less time consuming that searching iteratively thru an array
compared to a k-arry tree

k-ary tree = prefix tree


we must store where the words ends
our nodes have a end_word variable telling us where the word
finished
